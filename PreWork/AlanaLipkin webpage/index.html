	I'm a single mom of two kids in college, home alone with my dog and cat. The dog named Kashi, because Kashi isn't just for breakfast anymore. The cat's name is Randy Boots. She's a tuxedo cat who followed my son into the house and now we have a cat. They tolerate each other but aren't buddies. At night they both sleep in bed with me, and usually it's peaceful.
	
	Aside from pets, I'm also interested interested in genealogy, especially genetic genealogy and I've made many interesting (to me, anyway!) discoveries. I have found relatives on all continents except for Antarctica! I also love telling stories, listening to stories, and learning about science and tehnologoy.

	I've been working as a contact tracer, telling folks who have Covid to stay home. I feel like 2020 has lasted for a decade and I'm excited for this big change. I'm looking forward to learning with all of you.</p>
